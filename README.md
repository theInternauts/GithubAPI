an interview test

## Comments
- I would be happy to discuss my organizational choices with you in an interview and/or phonecall.
- I have been reading about the VIPER pattern for a few weeks now; so I thought I should try it out.  
  I'm not sure I implemented it correctly.  I have... thoughts about it.
- I made heavy use of protocols for easy(er) composability in the overall codebase. In theory, components can be more easily replaced in situ.
- I took this challenge
- I did not just sit down and type this all out from memory. Took this test an an opportunity to 
  try out more robust development methods--to try to do things better and step-it-up a bit. 
- Resources I referenced for guidance and safety are listed below.:

__resources:__

- Apple Docs
- https://www.raywenderlich.com/
- My own code from past projects
- https://appicon.co/
- https://blog.flaviocaetano.com/post/the-simplest-throttle-slash-debounce-youll-ever-see/  _(Becasue I had a feeling that I could be more threadsafe than by using a simple Timer instance)_
- https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/constructing-urls-in-swift/ _much easier to use (and extend) than my original implementation with ```URLSession``` and closures_
